# Assignment-Tracker

Purpose of the Application
This HTML code creates a task-tracking web application titled "Engineering Completion Tracker." The app allows students or users to manage and monitor tasks for different engineering subjects, organizing them into "To Do," "Remaining," and "Completed" categories. A login modal initially restricts access, displaying the main content only after successful login.
